	IPv4Address: added AddressCategory enum, getAddressCategory() function

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-08-03  Andras Varga

	IPvXAddress fix: a blank IPvXAddress was not equal to a blank
	IPv6Address

2011-07-24  Andras Varga

	cosmetics

2011-07-24  Andras Varga

	IPvXAddress: added isMulticast()

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: refactoring: more concise parsing of "localAddress" param

	Use cStringTokenizer and IPvXAddressResolver for parsing.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-03-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPvAddress optimalisation, code styling

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added GlobalARP support (from INETMANET)

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines

2009-12-21  Andras Varga

	minor: improved IPControlInfo/IPv6ControlInfo documentation + added
	getOrigDatagram() method

2009-12-21  Andras Varga

	when trying to delete origDatagram [fix suggested by vire]

2009-12-15  Andras Varga

	added words() and wordCount() functions bugfix in the equals() function

	Author: Zoltan Bojthe

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-09-12  Tamas Borbely

	* DLL export IPControlInfo and IPv6ControlInfo.

2008-09-09  Tamas Borbely

	* IPAddress: isLinkLocalMulticast() fixed. It accepted
	  244.0.0.x instead of 224.0.0.x.

2008-07-01  Andras Varga

	* InterfaceTable and associated files moved to new directory common/

2008-06-30  Andras Varga

	* IPAddress: internal representation changed to use a single int32
	instead of unsigned char[4], for more efficient code; several methods
	made inline [code from Ingmar Baumgart, OverSim]

	* parsim: added pack/unpack functions for IPAddress, IPv6Address,
	IPvXAddress

	* InterfaceTable: added deleteInterface()

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-10-28  Andras Varga

	* IPControlInfo.msg: added outputPort field

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	* created Network/Contract/ directory by moving files from
	Network/IPv4/ and Network/IPv6/

2005-07-12  Andras Varga

	* IPAddress, IPv6Address, IPvXAddress: renamed isNull() to
	isUnspecified()

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Network/IPv4 Network/IPv6 Network/Contract INET/src/networklayer/contract
