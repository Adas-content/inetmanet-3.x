2011-10-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	adds missing dup()

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	See base/ChangeLog for details.

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
