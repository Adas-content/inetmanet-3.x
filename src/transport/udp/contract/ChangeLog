	UDPSocket: removed callback support

	It didn't provide much utility value, and apparently nobody used it.

2011-07-25  Andras Varga

	Heavy API changes; added multicast, broadcast and ttl support

	Features/improvements:
	- added support for the following socket options (see Unix setsockopt()):
	  time-to-live (unicast and multicast), broadcast, multicast output
	  interface, join multicast group, leave multicast group.

	- UDPControlInfo was as a bit confusing, as it contained the union of
	  all fields needed for all commands/indications, so it was not
	  clear whether some field X was used for some command/indication,
	  and if so, what its exact role was. Specific UDPControlInfo classes
	  are now much more explicit about this.

	- UDPSocket class now contains much less state (clearer responsibilities,
	  less chance of disagreement with UDP module's view)

	Details:
	- UDPControlInfo has been split to: UDPBindCommand, UDPConnectCommand,
	  UDPSendCommand, UDPCloseCommand, and UDPDataIndication,
	  UDPErrorIndication for the opposite direction. Used with the
	  corresponding UDP_C_xxx and UDP_I_xxx message kinds.

	- UDP_C_UNBIND message kind has been renamed to UDP_C_CLOSE

	- added UDP_C_SETOPTION (for setting socket options);
	  it must be acompanied by any of: UDPSetTimeToLiveCommand,
	  UDPSetBroadcastCommand, UDPSetMulticastInterfaceCommand,
	  UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand, UDPLeaveMulticastGroupCommand.

	- the "unspecified" port number value has been changed from 0 to -1,
	  for consistency with other parameters in the NED file

	- userId was removed, as it hasn't offered a tremendous utility
	  value, and apparently nobody used it

	UDPSocket class:
	- now it stores minimal state (practically just the socket id),
	  and everything else is immediately sent down to the UDP module
	- new methods for socket options:
	     setTimeToLive(),
	     setBroadcast(),
	     setMulticastOutputInterface()
	     joinMulticastGroup()
	     leaveMulticastGroup()
	- new utility method:
	     getReceivedPacketInfo()
	- removed methods:
	     setUserId() / getUserId() -- userId is no longer;
	     getState() / stateName() -- state is not kept;
	     getLocalAddress() / getLocalPort() -- state is not kept;
	     setMulticastInterfaceId() / getMulticastInterfaceId() -- renamed

	UDP, UDPSocket: documentation updated

	Apparently the UDPSocket docu was a copy/paste of TCPSocket docu.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	UDPSocket: send() and sendTo() to accept cPackets only

	Note: in UDP, cMessage with UDP_C_DATA would cause "cannot cast" anyway.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
