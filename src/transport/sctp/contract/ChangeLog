	NEDDOC fixes

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Initial checkin of the SCTP code; SCTPCommand and SCTPSocket added to

	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- src/transport/contract INET/src/transport/contract
